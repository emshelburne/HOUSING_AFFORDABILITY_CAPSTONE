## Data-Driven Insights into Housing Trends: Forecasting Affordability Risks
=========================

### Executive Summary

This project addresses the urgent problem of housing affordability in Vancouver, particularly in the context of large-scale redevelopment plans like the Broadway Plan. While framed as a solution to the housing crisis, such plans have raised serious concerns among community members and housing advocates, who fear that high-rise developments may accelerate gentrification, displace renters, and make neighborhoods less affordable. The data science opportunity lies in using machine learning to analyze historical patterns of development and neighborhood-level economic indicators—such as rent, income, and vacancy rates—to build a predictive model that estimates how new construction may impact local affordability. By merging and processing datasets from CMHC, BC Assessment, and the City of Vancouver, this project aims to provide a rigorous, data-driven supplement to the ongoing public debate around urban development. While the project is in its early stages, the goal is to develop a publicly accessible tool or report that empowers community members and policymakers with transparent, evidence-based insights into the potential consequences of redevelopment.
